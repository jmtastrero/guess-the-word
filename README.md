# Guess The Word - Premium Edition (NOT Finish or Polish)

Guess The Word is an interactive Python game built with Tkinter, where players guess a hidden word based on a hint. The game features a fully functional onscreen QWERTY keyboard, a timer, lives system, and a mix of real/fake hints to challenge the player.

Features:
* Random Word Selection: Words are randomly chosen from a predefined list with true or fake hints.
* Interactive Onscreen Keyboard: Fully functional QWERTY layout, with disabled letters after selection.
* Lives System: Players have a limited number of lives. Incorrect guesses reduce lives.
* Timer: 60-second countdown for each game round.
* Endgame Options: If the player loses, Try Again and Quit buttons appear.
* Dynamic Hint System: Hints may be real or fake, adding an extra layer of challenge.
* Animated Feedback: Keyboard buttons change color when selected; lives and letters update in real time.
